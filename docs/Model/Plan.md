See documentation for descriptions of the different types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 
 **scheduleFixedDay**          | **int**                       | If a fixed day scheduling type is used a fixed day must be provided. For months the allowed value is 1-28 for weeks it is 1-7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [optional] 
 **baseMonth**                 | **int**                       | For fixed month schedule types the base month can be used to control which months are eligible for start of first billing period. The eligible months are calculated as &#x60;base_month + k * interval_length&#x60; up to 12. E.g. to use quaterly billing in the months jan-apr-jul-oct, &#x60;base_month&#x60; 1 and &#x60;interval_length&#x60; 3 can be used. If not defined the first fixed day will be used as start of first billing period.                                                                                                                   | [optional] 
 **noticePeriods**             | **int**                       | Optional number of notice periods for a cancel. The subscription will be cancelled for this number of full periods before expiring. Either from the cancellation date, or from the end of the the current period. See &#x60;notice_periods_after_current&#x60;. The default is to expire at the end of current period (0). A value of 1 (and &#x60;notice_periods_after_current&#x60; set to true) will for example result in a scenario where the subscription is cancelled until the end of current period, and then for the full subsequent period before expiring. | [optional] 
 **noticePeriodsAfterCurrent** | **bool**                      | If notice periods is set, this option controls whether the number of full notice periods should start at the end of the current period, or run from cancellation date and result in a partial period with partial amount for the last period. The default is true. E.g. if set to false and &#x60;notice_periods &#x3D; 1&#x60; then the subscription will be cancelled for exactly for one period from the cancellation time and a partial amount will be billed at the start of the next billing period.                                                             | [optional] 
 **fixationPeriods**           | **int**                       | Optional number of fixation periods. Fixation periods will guarantee that a subscription will have this number of paid full periods before expiring after a cancel. Default is to have no requirement (0).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [optional] 
 **fixationPeriodsFull**       | **bool**                      | If fixation periods are defined, and the subscription can have a partial prorated first period, this parameter controls if the the last period should be full, or partial to give exactly &#x60;fixation_periods&#x60; paid periods. Default is false.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [optional]
